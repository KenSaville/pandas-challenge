## Heroes of Pymoli

## Introduction

This project was an assignment for MSU Bootcamp. The purpose was to explore some features of the pandas library in Python.
We were given a data set consisiting of players of a game (Heroes of Pymoli) and various stats for each player.  The stats were mainly the types and
amounts of purchases made in the game - of weapons, and other odd game items.  We analyzed these stats in various ways:  Total player count, Overall purchase analysis (number of items purchased, avg price, etc), and purchasing analysis by gender and by age.  We then calculated, sorted and displayed results for top spenders, most popular items, and most profitable items.

The basic process in most analyses was to group the data by the category of interest (gender, age) using the gropby method, perform calculations on various subsets of the data (avg price, total count, etc), and display these results by category and / or sort them. 

This was all done using jupyter notebook via jupyter lab in Anaconda.
